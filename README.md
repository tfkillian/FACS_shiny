# FACS_shiny

## Shiny app for visualizing FACS and other count matrix data

This Shiny app takes .csv count matrix files (such as those resulting from FACS
analysis) as input and creates a series of dynamically generated diagnostic
plots using Plotly including PCA, tSNE, heatmap, correlation plot, and a violin
plot. The resulting figures can be downloaded as .png files.
